A tech demo where I made an in depth player controller, find out more about what I implemented and the controls for the controller <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Gameplay-Mechanics/tree/main/Unity/PC/Player%20Controller">here</a>.

Search For A Star 2022:

This was a long-term project and gave me the chance to properly refine and alter the game. I recieved some very valuable feedback from this game. I decided to upload the source code for this game and to also analyse the valuable feedback I recieved <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Search-For-A-Star-2022">here</a>.

CarsSwap:

I made this mod in GTA-V and it's one of my favourite mods I have made so far, it's a really simple mod but I find it really fun to play with this mod so I included it. You can access the source code and dll file <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Modding/tree/main/GTA-V/CarSwap">here</a>.

AnimalSpawn:

I made this mod in Red Dead Redemption 2 and is one of my favourite mods because I expanded my C++ knowledge by learning and implementing the ability to read .ini files and immediately use the values from that ini file without having to close the game. It's also just really fun to play around with and have the mod spawn different animals at different positions at different time frames.
