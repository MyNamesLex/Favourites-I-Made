Survival Horror Game:


This was the first time I explored NavMesh/NavMeshAgent In Unity and i was really happy with the results when I finally got it to work properly and had a solid foundation on how it works and how to set it up properly

Professional Development Game:

This was an important game I made in a team in University, it taught me a lot about what I like / don't like about working in a team and helped me develop a lot of important skills on how to deal with people in all sorts of scenarios as a leader in a team.

Falling Game I made in my first year of University:


This may not be the most sophisticated/best game I have ever made but I am still really fond of this one because the sense of accomplishment I got from making a game that actually felt like a proper game was unparralleled for me and it holds a lot of memories and overall reason why I love to make games
