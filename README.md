# Favourites-I-Made

(Made using the Unity Game Engine using C#)

Search For A Star 2022:

This was a long-term project and gave me the chance to properly refine and alter the game. I recieved some very valuable feedback from this game. I decided to upload the source code <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Search-For-A-Star-2022">here</a> to show the code I made for this game and also analyse the valuable feedback I recieved.
