# Favourites-I-Made

Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2:

A game where I explored many different aspects of Unity and learnt how to make assets by myself by using software like SFXR, Blender and Bosca Ceoil. I like this game as an overall product overall also.

KyteBot:

Having fun making a Discord Bot passively, it isn't fully functional but I like what I made so far

Procedural Generation:

I learned a lot from following the Brackey's tutorial and I think it looks really cool, I also did a different type of terrain generation aswell which is also cool looking but personally, i really like the wave effect that I added to Procedural-Generation.rar
