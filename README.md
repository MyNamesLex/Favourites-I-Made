Survival Horror Game:


this was the first time I explored NavMesh/NavMeshAgent In Unity and i was really happy with the results when I finally got it to work properly and had a solid foundation on how it works and how to set it up properly

Falling Game I made in my first year of University:


this may not be the most sophisticated/best game I have ever made but I am still really fond of this one because the sense of accomplishment I got from making a game that actually felt like a proper game was unparralleled for me and it holds a lot of memories and overall reason why I love to make games
