This features Coyote Jump, Jump Buffer, Slide, Crouch, Wall Running, Jump, Pistol, Shotgun and Knife Mechanics, First Person Camera Controller, Ground Slam, Upwards and Downwards gravity. On the more programming side it features a finite state machine to help with ease of development.

Search For A Star 2022:

This was a long-term project and gave me the chance to properly refine and alter the game. I recieved some very valuable feedback from this game. I decided to upload the source code <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Search-For-A-Star-2022">here</a> to show the code I made for this game and also analyse the valuable feedback I recieved.

CarsSwap:

I made this mod in GTA-V and it's one of my favourite mods I have made so far, it's a really simple mod but I find it really fun to play with this mod so I included it. You can access the code and dll file <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Modding/tree/main/GTA-V/CarSwap">here</a>
