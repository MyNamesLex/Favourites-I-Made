# Favourites-I-Made

Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2:

A game where I explored many different aspects of Unity and game development as a whole and learnt how to become more independant In making games by making more of the things for my games myself by using software like SFXR, Blender and Bosca Ceoil. I like this game as an overall product overall also.

Falling Game I made in my first year of University:


This may not be the most sophisticated/best game I have ever made but I am still really fond of this one because the sense of accomplishment I got from making a game that actually felt like a proper game was unparalleled for me and it holds a lot of memories and overall reason why I love to make games
