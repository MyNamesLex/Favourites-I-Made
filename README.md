# Favourites-I-Made

(Made using the Unity Game Engine using C#)

Player Controller:

A tech demo where I made an in depth player controller, find out more about what I implemented and the controls for the controller <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Gameplay-Mechanics/tree/main/Unity/PC/Player%20Controller">here</a>.

This features Coyote Jump, Jump Buffer, Slide, Crouch, Wall Running, Jump, Pistol, Shotgun and Knife Mechanics, First Person Camera Controller, Ground Slam, Upwards and Downwards gravity. On the more programming side it features a finite state machine to help with ease of development.

Third Person Player Controller:

A tech demo where I made a third person player controller. Find out the controls, access to the build and source code <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Gameplay-Mechanics/tree/main/Unreal%20Engine%205/PC/Third%20Person%20Controller">here</a>.

This features the use of blend spaces for smoother animations for different movement inputs from the player. The different movement inputs includes crawling, crouching, jumping, sprinting and the ability to move the camera closer or further from the player. 

(Do note that I could not find animations for crawling to the left, back or right so I could not do a blend space for those animations or different animations for different crawling inputs.)

Search For A Star 2022:

This was a long-term project and gave me the chance to properly refine and alter the game. I recieved some very valuable feedback from this game. I decided to upload the source code <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Search-For-A-Star-2022">here</a> for this game and to also analyse the valuable feedback I recieved.

CarsSwap:

I made this mod in GTA-V and it's one of my favourite mods I have made so far, it's a really simple mod but I find it really fun to play with this mod so I included it. You can access the source code and dll file <a href="https://github.com/MyNamesLex/Modding/tree/main/GTA-V/CarSwap">here</a>
