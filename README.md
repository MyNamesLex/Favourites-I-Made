# Favourites-I-Made

Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2:

A game where I explored many different aspects of Unity and learnt how to make assets by myself by using software like SFXR, Blender and Bosca Ceoil. I like this game as an overall product overall also.

Procedural Generation:

I learned a lot from following the Brackey's tutorial and I think it looks really cool, I also did a different type of terrain generation aswell which is also cool looking but personally, i really like the wave effect that I added to this one
